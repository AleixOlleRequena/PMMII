Project: Creation of a robot that uses a camera to check if people that enter a building are wearing a mask. If they are wearing it, the robot congratulates them
and offer some hand gel.
In this case, I have created the code to control and move a robot using FireBase, the controller sends the joysticks information to FireBase and the RaspBerry Pi reads
it to move the different electric motors. The robot also has a camera and sends the images using RPI Cam Web Interface. The code is programmed using Python.
